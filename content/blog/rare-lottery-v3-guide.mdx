# Rare Lottery: How to Turn Your Claims into Jackpots

What do you do with your RARE once you've claimed it? You could stake it, you could hold it, or you could try to turn it into a **life-changing jackpot.**

Introducing **Rare Lottery V3**, the modernized, decentralized lottery built specifically for the Rare Coin ecosystem on the Base Chain.

## Provably Fair & Secure

The biggest problem with traditional crypto lotteries is "Predictable Randomness." In the past, miners could manipulate block headers to influence the winner. We've fixed that.

**RareLotteryV3** is designed to integrate with **Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** and **Pyth Entropy.** This means the winner is chosen by a tamper-proof, off-chain source of randomness that is then verified on-chain. Nobody—not even the developers—can influence who wins.

## Multiple Ways to Win

We've made the lottery accessible to everyone. You can enter using two different methods:

1.  **Native ETH:** Use a tiny amount of Base ETH to buy a ticket.
2.  **RARE Tokens:** Use your claimed RARE to enter directly.

When a winner is drawn, they receive **100% of the accumulated prize pool**—including both the Native ETH and the RARE tokens.

## Anti-Whale Protections

To keep the game fair and prevent "whales" from buying up the entire lottery, we've implemented a **5-ticket limit per address per round.** 

This ensures that the lottery remains a fun, community-driven game where everyone has a real chance to win, regardless of the size of their wallet.

## The Minimum Player Rule

A lottery isn't a lottery if there's only one person playing. To ensure every win is meaningful, a round cannot be drawn until at least **3 unique players** have entered. If the timer expires and there aren't enough players, the round stays open until the community steps up.

## How to Enter

1.  Visit the **Lottery** tab on [rare.claims](https://rare.claims).
2.  Choose your entry method (ETH or RARE).
3.  Confirm the transaction.
4.  Wait for the draw!

The best part? Every claim you make on the Fountain gives you enough RARE to enter the lottery. We've designed the ecosystem to be a continuous loop of claiming, playing, and winning.
