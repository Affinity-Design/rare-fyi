# How to Claim Your Rare Coin on Base

The era of Rare Coin on Gnosis has come to an end. We are moving to **Base**, the Ethereum L2 by Coinbase, to bring you faster transactions, lower fees, and a massive ecosystem of real users.

If you held RARE, provided liquidity, or staked on Gnosis Chain, this guide is for you.

## 🧱 Step 1: The Gnosis Shutdown
To ensure a fair transition, the original Rare Fountain on Gnosis has been decommissioned. A final snapshot was taken at the moment of shutdown, capturing:
- Every **RARE** token holder.
- Every **RARE/xDAI LP** provider on Honeyswap.
- Every **Staker** in the original staking contract.

## 📸 Step 2: The Combined Snapshot
We didn't just look at wallet balances. We calculated the "Underlying RARE" for every participant. 
- **LP Holders:** We looked inside the Honeyswap pool and credited you for the RARE tokens your LP tokens represented.
- **Stakers:** Your locked amounts were fully accounted for.

This data has been compiled into a secure **Merkle Tree**, which powers the new claim system on Base.

## 🚀 Step 3: How to Claim on Base

### 1. Switch to Base Chain
Open your wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rabby) and switch your network to **Base**. If you haven't added Base yet, you can do so automatically at [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/chain/8453).

### 2. Visit Rare Claims
Head over to the official portal: **[rare.claims](https://rare.claims)**.

### 3. Connect Your Wallet
Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button. Make sure you use the *same address* you used on Gnosis Chain.

### 4. Check Your Eligibility
The dashboard will automatically scan our Merkle Tree. If you were part of the Gnosis snapshot, your "Migrated Balance" will appear.

### 5. Claim Your V3 Tokens
Click **"Claim Airdrop"**. You will need a tiny amount of Base ETH for gas (pennies). Once the transaction is confirmed, your new **Rare Token V3** will be in your wallet.

## 🛡️ Step 4: Secure Your Humanity
Once you've claimed your initial migration, you can start participating in the new **Fountain** for daily distributions. To keep bots out, you'll need to satisfy one of our 3-Tier Proof of Humanity requirements:
1. **Manual Whitelist** (Auth'd by manager).
2. **RARE Holding** (Initially 1,000 RARE).
3. **Basename** (Ownership of a Base Username).

## 🎰 What’s Next?
Once you have your RARE on Base, the ecosystem is yours to explore:
- **Staking:** Lock your tokens for 7, 28, or 84 days to earn multipliers.
- **Lottery:** Enter our provably fair lottery for a chance at the jackpot.
- **AI Agents:** Soon, you'll be able to use your RARE to fuel AI trading agents.
