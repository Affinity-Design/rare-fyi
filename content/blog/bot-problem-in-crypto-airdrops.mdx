# The Bot Problem in Crypto Airdrops

If you've ever participated in a crypto airdrop, you've probably felt it.

You did everything right. You followed the instructions. You waited patiently.

And when the distribution happened... you got almost nothing.

Meanwhile, someone else got 100x what you did.

How? **Bots.**

## The Scale of the Problem

This isn't a small issue. It's systemic.

### By the Numbers

- **70-90%** of airdrop participants in some projects are suspected bots
- Bot operators can create **thousands of wallet addresses** in minutes
- A single bot farm can capture **millions of dollars** in airdrop value
- Legitimate users often receive **less than 1%** of intended allocations

### Real Examples

We've seen this play out repeatedly:

1. **Uniswap UNI airdrop** — Sybil attacks identified post-distribution
2. **ENS airdrop** — Sophisticated farming strategies exploited the system
3. **Optimism OP** — Multiple wallets receiving tokens meant for individuals

Every major airdrop faces this problem. Most don't talk about it.

## How Bots Work

Understanding the enemy is the first step to defeating it.

### 1. Scale

Bots don't create one wallet. They create thousands.

```
Bot Farm Setup:
- 1,000 unique wallets
- Each claims daily
- 1,000 claims per day
- 30,000 claims per month
```

A single bot operator can capture more allocation than 10,000 real users.

### 2. Automation

Bots don't sleep. They don't forget. They don't get tired.

```
Bot Claim Cycle:
- Monitor blockchain for claim window
- Execute claim within milliseconds
- Repeat across all wallets
- 24/7/365
```

No human can compete with this.

### 3. Timing

Bots have perfect timing. They:

- Monitor mempool for pending transactions
- Execute claims at the optimal moment
- Front-run other participants when possible

### 4. Obfuscation

Sophisticated bots hide their activity:

- Distributed across multiple IP addresses
- Randomized timing to appear human
- Varied transaction amounts
- Mixers to hide fund flows

## Why Existing Solutions Fail

### CAPTCHA Alone

**Problem:** CAPTCHAs can be solved by:
- CAPTCHA-solving services ($0.001-0.01 per solve)
- Machine learning models
- Human workers in low-cost countries

**Result:** A small cost that doesn't stop determined bot operators.

### KYC Requirements

**Problem:** 
- Creates friction for real users
- Privacy concerns
- Fake identities still work
- Doesn't prevent multiple accounts per identity

**Result:** Real users are frustrated; bots find workarounds.

### Social Verification

**Problem:**
- Social accounts can be purchased
- Bot farms have verified accounts
- Doesn't scale to thousands of verifications

**Result:** Easy to fake at scale.

## A Better Approach: Economic Barriers

The most effective bot deterrent is simple: **make it expensive.**

### Stake-to-Claim

**How it works:**
1. To claim, you must first stake tokens
2. Stake is locked during claim period
3. Stake is returned after successful claim
4. Multiple claims require multiple stakes

**Why it works:**
- Bot with 1,000 wallets needs 1,000 stakes
- Economic cost scales linearly with attack scale
- Real users stake once; bots must stake infinitely
- Attack becomes unprofitable

**Example:**
```
Claim reward: 10 RARE (worth $10)
Stake requirement: 100 RARE (worth $100)

Bot needs: 1,000 wallets × 100 RARE = 100,000 RARE ($100,000)
Bot gets: 1,000 × 10 RARE = 10,000 RARE ($10,000)

Attack loses $90,000 → Not profitable
```

### Rate Limiting

**How it works:**
- Limit claims per address per time period
- Limit registrations per IP per day
- Slow down the attack surface

**Why it works:**
- Bots rely on speed and volume
- Rate limits reduce both
- Gives legitimate users time to participate

### Multi-Layer Defense

No single solution is perfect. The answer is layers:

```
Layer 1: Cloudflare Turnstile (catch basic bots)
    ↓
Layer 2: Stake-to-Claim (economic barrier)
    ↓
Layer 3: Rate Limiting (temporal barrier)
    ↓
Layer 4: On-chain Analysis (pattern detection)
    ↓
Layer 5: Community Reporting (crowdsourced security)
```

Each layer catches what the previous missed.

## What We're Building at Rare Coin

We're implementing all of these defenses:

### 1. Stake-to-Claim
Every claim requires staked tokens. Bots would need to stake millions to game the system.

### 2. Cloudflare Turnstile
Modern CAPTCHA alternative that catches automated scripts.

### 3. Dual Pool System
Two alternating distribution pools make timing attacks harder.

### 4. Rate Limiting
24-hour cooldowns between registrations per address.

### 5. Transparent Monitoring
All bot detection is logged and visible. Community can verify fairness.

## The Future of Fair Distribution

Bot attacks aren't going away. As crypto grows, the incentives only increase.

But we can fight back. With:

- **Economic barriers** that make attacks unprofitable
- **Technical barriers** that make attacks difficult
- **Transparency** that makes attacks visible
- **Community vigilance** that makes attacks risky

Fair distribution is possible. It just requires intentional design.
