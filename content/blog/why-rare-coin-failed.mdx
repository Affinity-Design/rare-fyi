# Why Rare Coin Failed and How We're Fixing It

Let's be honest: the original Rare Coin had problems.

We're not going to pretend everything was perfect. It wasn't. And if we want to build something better, we need to start by acknowledging what went wrong.

## The Bot Problem

The biggest issue? **Bots.**

When we launched the original distribution system, we assumed most participants would be real humans. We were wrong.

### What Happened

Within days of launch, sophisticated bot networks had discovered our claiming system. They:

- Created thousands of wallet addresses
- Automated daily claims across all of them
- Gamed the distribution timing perfectly
- Left real users with almost nothing

### The Result

Legitimate users — the people we built this for — were getting fractions of what they should have earned. Meanwhile, bot operators were accumulating massive amounts of RARE.

That wasn't fair. That wasn't what we promised.

## What We Learned

We made mistakes. Here's what we know now:

### 1. BrightID Wasn't Enough

We relied on BrightID for human verification. It helped, but it wasn't sufficient. Sophisticated bot operators found ways around it.

**The fix:** We're implementing multi-layer verification:
- Cloudflare Turnstile (CAPTCHA)
- Stake-to-Claim (economic barrier)
- Rate limiting (temporal barrier)

### 2. No Economic Cost to Claim

When claiming is free, there's no cost to creating infinite bot wallets.

**The fix:** Stake-to-Claim. To register, you must lock up tokens. Bots would need to stake millions to game the system — making it economically unviable.

### 3. Predictable Timing

Bots could time their claims perfectly because our distribution windows were predictable.

**The fix:** We're implementing randomized claim windows and dual-pool systems that make timing attacks much harder.

### 4. Wrong Chain

We were on a chain with unreliable RPCs and limited infrastructure.

**The fix:** We're moving to Base Chain — fast, affordable, and backed by Coinbase.

## What's Changing

### New Supply: 1 Million Tokens

The original had a much larger supply. We're reducing it to **1 million RARE** — making it genuinely rare.

### Bot-Proof Distribution

Every claim will require:
1. Turnstile verification
2. Staked tokens
3. Rate limit compliance
4. Wallet signature

### Base Chain

Faster transactions, lower fees, better infrastructure.

### Real Utility

This isn't just about claiming. We're building:
- Staking with real APY
- Lottery with Chainlink VRF (verifiable randomness)
- AI trading bot
- Swap aggregator

## Our Promise

We're not going to pretend the past didn't happen. We're going to:

1. **Be transparent** about what went wrong
2. **Fix the problems** with real technical solutions
3. **Build for the long term** — not a quick cash grab
4. **Put community first** — real humans, not bots

## What's Next

- **Phase 1:** Website launch (you're looking at it)
- **Phase 2:** Contract audits and fixes
- **Phase 3:** dApp development
- **Phase 4:** Testnet deployment
- **Phase 5:** Mainnet launch

We'll share progress every step of the way.
