# Stake-to-Claim: Our Nuclear Option Against Bots

The biggest threat to any crypto community isn't the bear market—it's **Sybil Attacks.** 

In the traditional "Free Airdrop" model, a single bot operator can create 10,000 wallets for less than $50. They then script these wallets to claim every day, effectively stealing the tokens intended for the community. **Rare Coin is putting a stop to this.**

## The Economic Barrier

On our new Base Chain deployment, we are introducing **Stake-to-Claim.** This is our "nuclear option" against bot farms. 

Instead of a "free-for-all," registration for our distribution pools requires an economic commitment. If a bot operator wants to game the system with 1,000 wallets, they would need to buy and lock up thousands of RARE tokens across every single one. This makes the cost of the attack higher than the potential reward—instantly making botting non-profitable.

## The 3-Tier Proof of Humanity

To make the system flexible but secure, we've implemented three distinct ways to prove you're a human and gain access to the Fountain:

### Tier 1: Manual Whitelist
For our core community members and early supporters, the manager can manually authorize addresses. This is the highest level of trust and bypasses other requirements.

### Tier 2: RARE Holding (Dynamic Threshold)
This is the most common path. By holding a minimum amount of RARE in your wallet, you are automatically eligible to register. 
*   **Dynamic Scaling:** The manager can adjust this threshold (e.g., from 1,000 RARE down to 10 RARE) as the value of the token increases, ensuring that new humans can always join without a high barrier to entry.

### Tier 3: Base Username (Basenames)
We are leaning into the Base ecosystem. If you own a **Basename** (a Base ENS subname), you are automatically verified as a human participant. This leverages the growing "on-chain identity" movement powered by Coinbase.

## Why 24h Rate Limiting?

Even with a whitelist, bots can still try to automate the process. That's why every claim is protected by a mandatory **24-hour cooldown.** This ensures that distribution is spread out over time, preventing "flash-drains" and giving everyone a fair shot at the daily pool.

## Fair is the Future

By combining **Stake-to-Claim** with our **Dual-Pool System**, we are building the most resilient distribution engine on the Base Chain. We aren't interested in fake user numbers or bot-inflated metrics. We want real humans, real holders, and real utility.
